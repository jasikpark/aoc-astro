# Today's day two

We are meant to calculate a score based on the input, the first character on a
line being the opponent's play in rock, paper, scissors, and the second
character being ours.

Let's write a test for our examples today too.

We'll import the input again.

import input from "/aoc/inputs/02.txt?raw";

```ts
import input from "/aoc/inputs/02.txt?raw";
```

We'll use [`uvu`](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu) for testing, due to its ability
to be run w/o a custom test runner.

```ts
import { test } from "uvu";
import * as assert from "uvu/assert";
```

import { test } from "uvu";
import * as assert from "uvu/assert";

We can then build start on some TDD (test-driven development)!

export const testInput = `A Y
B X
C Z`;

The example input is

```ts
const testInput = `A Y
B X
C Z`;
```

> This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:
>
> In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose
> Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose
> Paper + 6 because you won). In the second round, your opponent will choose
> Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a
> score of 1 (1 + 0). The third round is a draw with both players choosing
> Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.

import check from "pico-check";

export const attempt1 = (input) => {
  return 3;
};

export const testAttempt1 = (t) => {
  t.is(attempt1(testInput), 6);
};

export let testResult1;

export const garbage1 = check({ testAttempt1 }).then((x) => (testResult1 = x));

import attempt1Raw from "./attempt1.ts?raw";

<Code code={attempt1Raw} lang="ts" />

```ts
const attempt1 = (input) => {
  return 3;
};

const testAttempt1 = (t) => {
  t.is(attempt1(testInput), 6);
};

console.debug(await check({ testAttempt1 }));
```

<pre>
  <code>{JSON.stringify(testResult1, null, 2)}</code>
</pre>

This fails b/c we're just returning a hardcoded number.

Let's build a more complex implementation xD

export const attempt2 = (input) => {
    return input.split('\n').map((line) => line.split(' ')).map((([them, me]) => {
        console.log('lol')
    })).reduce((sum, [them, me]) => {
let round = 0;

if(me === "X") {round += 1;}

if(me === "Y"){ round += 2;}

if(me === "Z") {round += 3;}

if(them === me) { round += 3; return round; }

    }, 0)

}
